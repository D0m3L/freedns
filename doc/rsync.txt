Quick setup of rsync
====================

Of course change paths and hostnames to suit your needs.
Also make sure named is configured properly, serves the
zones and gets reloaded properly. :)

Step 1. On a shadow-host name server:
(Note: as we get only zone configurations, you have to
create some "empty" header with include statement, that
would look very similar to master-host named config.)

# cat /etc/rsyncd.conf
uid = nobody
gid = nogroup
use chroot = no
max connections = 3
syslog facility = local5
pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
[freedns]
    # you could play with hosts allow here, too
    path = /var/cache/bind/freedns
    comment = FreeDNS
    uid = named
    gid = named
    read only = false
    strict modes = true
    auth users = freedns
    secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets
# cat /etc/rsyncd.secrets
freedns:somepass
# grep rsync /etc/inetd.conf
rsync stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon
# crontab -l nameduser
45 * * * * rndc reload

Step 2. On a master-host name server:

$ cat bin/rsync.sh
#!/bin/sh
cd $HOME/FreeDNS/named/
RSYNC_PASSWORD=somepass
export RSYNC_PASSWORD
# Note that we only sync freedns.conf, which contains only zone conf,
# without named.conf, which contains named conf header, with options,
# paths, keys etc. YMMV!
# We also of course sync whole directory 'masters', where all primary
# zones are kept; content of 'slaves' directory (with secondary zones)
# should be created by named itself
/usr/local/bin/rsync -qrz var/masters etc/freedns.conf \
	freedns@shadow-host::freedns/
$ crontab -l
40 * * * *   $HOME/xname-engine/bin/rsync.sh

That's all! At least that's how it works at my site. :)
